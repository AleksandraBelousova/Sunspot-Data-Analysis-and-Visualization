## Overview

The Sunspot Data Analysis and Visualization project aims to extract, transform, and load (ETL) historical sunspot data from a CSV file. 

## Project Structure

1. ETL Process:
   - Extraction: Load CSV data into a DataFrame using Pandas.
   - Transformation: Clean the data and compute additional insights such as log transformations.
   - Loading: Store the transformed data in an SQLite database for further access.

2. Data Analysis:
   - Create a timestamp column for ease of time series analysis.
   - Use Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data visualization.
   - Employ techniques like rolling averages to smooth data and reveal underlying trends and patterns.

3. Results and Insights:
   - Examination of the trend and cyclical nature of sunspot occurrences over time.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SQLAlchemy

## How to Run the Project
1. Preparation:
   - Ensure you have Google Colab access or a local Python environment with the required libraries installed.
2. Execution on Google Colab:
   - Upload your CSV file containing sunspot data into Google Colab.
   - Execute the ETL script provided in your Google Colab environment.
   - Run the analysis script to generate visualizations and insights.
3. Execution Locally:
   - Clone the project repository.
   - Install the required Python libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Run the Python script using your preferred environment.
